The National Science Foundation’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory – also known as NOIRLab – published a notice on Tuesday night explaining that the lab had discovered an attempted cyberattack on its systems that morning.  The attack forced the “suspension of astronomical observations at Gemini North in Hawai'i.” Located in Maunakea, Gemini North is one of the Gemini Observatory's two telescopes, with the other in Chile, and is an international science partnership between the U.S., Canada, Chile, Brazil, Argentina and South Korea.

“Quick reactions by the NOIRLab cyber security team and observing teams prevented damage to the observatory.

Several water monitors – which monitor irrigation systems and wastewater treatment systems – were left dysfunctional on Sunday after a cyber attack targeted the monitoring systems.  Specifically, water controllers for irrigating fields in the Jordan Valley were damaged, as were control systems for the Galil Sewage Corporation.

The management for both major systems was pushing all of Sunday morning to work through the issue and bring the systems back into full operation.  Farmers in the region were warned several days prior about suspicions over a planned cyber attack. Some of them, as a result of the warning, disconnected the remote control option for their irrigation systems and switched them to manual operation, instead, to prevent any harm from the attack. Indeed, those who left their systems on remote control were the ones impacted by the attack.

The attack is thought to be part of an annual “hacktivist” campaign that takes place every April, and this year’s attempt at least managed to cause a nuisance for some farms in the Jordan Valley.  The cyber attack is part of an annual campaign called “OpIsrael,” which strikes in April with DDoS attacks and breach attempts on targets in the country.

Each year of the cyber attack campaign seems to bring new targets of opportunity. This year the threat actors put a special focus on irrigation systems.

The incident has affected more than 80% of IT infrastructure, with the loss of key patient information and diagnostics, resulting in severe impacts on the health service and the provision of care. All computer systems were switched off. Doctors, nurses and other workers lost access to systems for patient information, clinical care and laboratories. Emails went down, and staff had to turn to pen and paper.Lab test data had to be handwritten and manually entered - leading to greater risks of mistakes. Thousands of people's healthcare was disrupted. Confidential medical files were also stolen, with hackers threatening to release the data. A response was quickly mobilised internally, and the Irish Defence Forces were called in to help.

HSE commissioned PWC for independent report on the cyber attack: On 18 March, someone in the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) opened a spreadsheet that had been sent to them by email two days earlier. But the file was compromised with malware. The criminal gang behind the email spent the next two months working their way through the networks.  There were multiple warning signs that they were at work, but no investigation was launched, and that meant a crucial opportunity to intervene was missed, according to the report, and on May 14 the ransomware was released.     Senior staff set up a ""war room"", but the report criticises the lack of preparation or contingency planning for such a loss of systems.  ""The response teams could not initially focus on the highest priority response and recovery tasks due to the lack of preparedness for a widespread disruptive IT event,"" it says.

The attackers demanded payment to restore access to the computer systems,  Then on 20 May, the attackers, for reasons not entirely clear - but perhaps realizing the scale of what was happening - posted a link to a key that would decrypt files.

Stuxnet has 3 major components; A worm module, A link file and a rootkit module.  The worm propagates across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling a PLC. In the absence of either criterion, Stuxnet becomes dormant inside the computer. If both the conditions are fulfilled, Stuxnet introduces the infected rootkit onto the PLC and Step7 software, modifying the code and giving unexpected commands to the PLC while returning a loop of normal operation system values back to the users.

Boden was having a “strained relationship” with Hunter Watertech and left the company. He then applied for a job with the Maroochy Shire Council. The Council did not hire him, so he decided to get even with both the Council and Hunter Watertech.  He loaded his car with radio equipment attached to a configuration computer and drove around the area on at least 46 occasions from February 28 to April 23, 2000, issuing radio commands to the sewage equipment that he (probably) helped install. He caused 800,000 liters of raw sewage to spill out into local parks, rivers and even the grounds of a Hyatt Regency hotel. A representative of the Australian Environmental Protection Agency representative stated that the creek water had turned black, Marine life died, and the stench was unbearable for residents.

The cameras were installed on residential buildings in Kyiv and were initially used by residents to monitor the surrounding area and parking lot. After hacking them, the Russian intelligence services supposedly gained remote access to the cameras, changed their viewing angles, and connected them to YouTube to stream sensitive footage.

According to Ukraine’s security service, SBU, this footage likely helped Russians direct drones and missiles toward Kyiv during a large-scale missile strike against Ukraine on Tuesday.
